## How to Contribute

For contributing to Open Climate Fix project, we recommend following these detailed steps.

### Step 1: Find an Issue to Work On
Begin by exploring the issues listed on the project's GitHub [issues](https://github.com/openclimatefix/Open-Source-Quartz-Solar-Forecast/issues) page. If you're new to the project, look for issues tagged with `good first issue`, these are specifically selected to be more accessible for newcomers. Selecting an issue that aligns with your interests or expertise is a great way to contribute effectively.

### Step 2: Communicate Your Interest
Before diving into coding, it's a good practice to comment on the issue you're interested in. This lets the maintainers know you're working on it and prevents duplicate efforts. It's also an excellent opportunity to ask any clarifying questions and discuss your approach.

### Step 3: Create a New Branch
For every new contribution, create a branch in your local repository. A branch is a way to keep your changes seprate from the main part of the project called `main`. This branch should be based off the main project's latest main branch.  Naming your branch with a convention like `feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/issue-description` can help identify its purpose.

### Step 4: Open a Pull Request (PR)
Once you're satisfied with your contribution, push your branch to your fork on GitHub and open a pull request against the original Open Climate Fix repository. In your pull request description, reference the issue you're addressing and provide a summary of your changes. Providing screenshots or output snippets can be particularly helpful for visual changes or user interface improvements.

### Step 5: Request a Review
After submitting your pull request, you can request a review from the project maintainers or specific contributors by mentioning them in your PR comments. Once your pull request is approved, a project maintainer will merge it into the main branch.

> Don't forget to keep your local repository and fork updated with the main project to ease future contributions.
